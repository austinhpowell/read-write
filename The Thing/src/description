The Thing is an interactive program that is modeled after John Carpenter’s movie, The Thing. Essentially, 8 people are made with random 
traits(eye-color, persona, carziness) and one person is turned into an alien. Then, all the humans move to 4 places (lab, storeroom, outside, and rec room) randomly. 
Then aliens then try to choose a room that only has one person. If the alien finds a room with only one person, it will try to attack 
that person and turn that person into an alien. When a person is turned into an alien, there is a 25% chance that most of the attributes 
are replicated perfectly. There is a 75% that the eye-color and persona will change. However, every alien has zero craziness and is calm.
This is a way the player can identify an alien but there are some humans that are this calm.

The player will move to one place of his/her choice every turn. If an alien is attacking someone, the player will stop the attack and save 
the person from becoming an alien. If there is no one in the room then nothing happens. If there is no attack in the room then the player 
learns every attribute about the people in there for future reference, regardless of whether they are human or alien. 
If there is one alien in a place, the player learns that alien’s identity 
and runs away. The player can choose to go into the endgame at the end of any turn by calling a meeting and deciding who the player thinks is human and who
 the player thinks is an alien. The results are then displayed in a JFrame that has a close button .
